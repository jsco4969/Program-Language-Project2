# Program-Language-Project2


## Introduction
This project aims to introduce students to object-oriented languages, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, modularity, encapsulation, sub-typing, and overloading VIA, creating a quadtree data structure in Java. Students are expected to use CS project management techniques and technologies to simplify the development process and submit their code for grading. Through a class vote, all projects are **INDIVIDUAL**, and as a result, there should not be any duplicate code within reason. If there is significant plagiarism in a submission, I will mark all submissions with the same code with a 0.

## Project Details
- For this project, you’ll create a quadtree data structure and manipulate it with data. To ensure you learn proper object-oriented programming techniques, there will be a few requirements for your implementation of this project. Namely:

    - You must have a base Node class.<br>
    - You must have an InternalNode class that inherits from the base Node class.<br>
    - You must have a LeafNode class that inherits from the base Node class.<br>

- You’re tasked with implementing five operations on your data structure:<br>
    - Insert Rectangle – insert a rectangle into the quadtree.<br>
    - Delete Rectangle – delete a rectangle from the quadtree.<br>
    - Find Rectangle – find a rectangle in the quadtree.<br>
    - Dump tree – print the quadtree.<br>
    - Update Rectangle – change the length and width of a rectangle

## How to run program
Put in terminal:
``java -cp target/classes quadtree.Main commands.cmmd``
